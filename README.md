You made it! If you're reading this, you've either made it to the github page
or successfully cloned this repository and have a local copy. If you haven't
figured out what it means to "clone" a repository, you should do that now. If
you're looking for more information, [github has very useful documentation
that is focused on the command-line tool for
git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#basic-git). If you
prefer to use a GUI, I recommend [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
