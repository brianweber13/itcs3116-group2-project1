# ITCS 3166 Group 2 Project 1
## Getting Started With Development
 1. We encourage using eclipse. If you'd like to use another IDE, continue to
    [basic info](##basic-info) and make sure that you can get everything we use
    working with your IDE.
 1. [Download eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and install it with
    support for Java.
 1. Clone this repository. If you don't know how to clone a repository, go to
    the ["how to use git"](##how-to-use-git) section.
 1. Open the folder you just cloned in eclipse by using `File -> Open Projects
    From Filesystem` in eclipse.
 1. Make a new branch
 1. Code away!
 1. Submit a merge request when you have completed a feature on your branch and
    would like it merged into master. Assign someone else in the team to review
    the changes.

## Basic Info
 * We use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) for dependency
   management.
 * We use [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) for testing.
 * We encourage using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) for an IDE, but you
   are welcome to use whatever you're comfortable with.

## How to use Git
[Github has very useful documentation that is focused on the command-line tool
for git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/). If you prefer
to use a GUI, still read the github page, but you can use
[gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). If you use gitkraken, start by reading
[this page](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/guide). It's an absolute
TREASURE TROVE of good information for beginners. When you've got a better
understanding of the basic git concepts, [this short
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4yvfrX_7I&list=PLe6EXFvnTV7-_41SpakZoTIYCgX4aMTdU)
will get you started with *using* gitkraken.

## Project Specification
The [course
website](https://webpages.uncc.edu/aatzache/ITCS3166/Project/GroupProjectAssignments1_to_9.txt)
describes the project as follows:

Presentation Subject: Sliding Window Protocols, Example Data Link Protocols
Chapter 3.4 - 3.5
implement:  Sliding Window Protocol - Go-Back-N p. 232

That same webpage includes a generic description for any group project. I have
added some notes, shown in bold.
1. Prepare 14 PowerPoint slides ( total for the Group ) on your assigned
subject (as shown below). **if I remember correctly, she told us in class that
we only needed ~10. Can anyone confirm or deny this?**
2. Find a youtube Video (or another video) on your assigned subject - not
longer than 2 minutes. Save the video link in a text file. **in our case, she
wants us to make a video of us demonstrating our progrm.... Is this in place of
or in addition to step 2?**
3. Implement your assigned algorithm (as shown below). Use - JAVA ( or
Scala ) - as a programming language . Create a User Interface . **we picked
Java**
4. One student should run a Demonstration of the code before the class
, and explain what is the purpose of the code , what inputs it
takes , what outputs it produces . 
5. Submit your project files: PowerPoint file, VideoLink, and
SourceCode to Canvas - due: 3 days prior to your assigned Group
Moderator Date presenation date ( shown on the syllabus ).
6. Present your PowerPoints, Video, and Implementation Demo to
the class on your assigned Group Moderator Date. ( shown on
the syllabus ). Presentation should not take more than 15
minutes altogether . **15 minutes with 5 of us is gonna go by FAST**
7. Each student presents 2 PowerPoint slide, and speaks for 1
to 2 minutes maximum , and prepares 1 question for the
audience based on his / her PowerPoint slides.
8. Answer questions. Each group will ask the Presenters 1
question. 
9. Bring CANDY / Sweets ( ex. chocolates ( sneakers ,
