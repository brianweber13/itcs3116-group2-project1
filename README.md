You made it! If you're reading this, you've either made it to the github page
or successfully cloned this repository and have a local copy. If you haven't
figured out what it means to "clone" a repository, you should do that now. If
you're looking for more information, [github has very useful documentation
that is focused on the command-line tool for
git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#basic-git). If you
prefer to use a GUI, I recommend [gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). If
you use gitkraken, start by reading [this
page](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/guide). It's an absolute
TREASURE TROVE of good information for beginners. When you've got a better
understanding of the basic git concepts, [this short
video](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/guide) will get you started
with *using* gitkraken.
